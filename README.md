# Primitive V1 Connectectors Contract Repository

## Documentation

The database of Primitive protocol contracts and documentation is hosted on notion here: [Primitive Protocol HQ](https://www.notion.so/primitivefi/Primitive-Protocol-HQ-fc081b939bb04e2a90ccaebf36faa78e)

## Contracts

Primitive is a protocol for decentralized option tokens.

These connector contracts bundle operations from other protocols or useful tools with Primitive V1 contract operations.

The live contract addresses are [here](https://www.notion.so/primitivefi/dc3b883ff9d94044b6738701b2826f7a?v=9e56507d430d4f4fb1939242cfb23736).

We use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) as a development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying the contracts.
